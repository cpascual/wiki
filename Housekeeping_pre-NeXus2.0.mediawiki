==Issue==
As an action item from the NIAC October 5-6, 2006 at LBL, Berkeley, CA, USA, housekeeping of base classes and instrument definitions was required before release of NeXus2.0

==Proposal: Definition of housekeeping tasks==
# set a release date for NeXus2.0
# define the task that can be achieved before the release date
#* data entities include either a desciption or a (list of) value(s) but not both e.g. [[NXdisk_chopper]] type has both description and a list of values
#* remove all "?" and "*" (i.e. all elements are optional)
#* leave all "+" 
#* fix typos and inconsistencies using a dictionary
#* check all units against the standard [[Units]]
Some of these task may not be possible in the timeframe

===Proposal: Execute housekeeping tasks===
It is proposed to execute these task using XSLT.
We (ANSTO) have been using regular expression in xslt to clean up the metaDTD for ANSTO use.
The tasks include:
# from the 'definition of housekeeping tasks', write the required xslt file
# Editors run the xslt file against the base classes and instrument definitions that generates a report which flag the points where the metaDTD diverges from the standard
# Editors fix the errors by hand and re-generate the reports
# Editor commits to nexusformat subversion repository
