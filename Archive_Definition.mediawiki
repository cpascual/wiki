== Introduction ==

This 'NeXus Archive Definition' proposal is similar to an 'Instrument Definition' but it describe the required information for neXus files that are meant to be centrally archived. It contains important information that will not be found in the instrument definition as they are not needed for data analysis. 

The Instrument Definitions should allow the creation of archiving software that are common among several instruments and/or facilities. With the Archive Definition, the aim is to allow shared data management tools. It also emphasize important information that will be useful for search and retrieve of the data once stored in the archive.

The Instrument Definitions and the Archive definition should not interfere with each other. To analyze the data of an instrument, you don't need to know the owner of the data or the name of the sample. 

Before archiving and indexing the data, we need to define the granularity with which to do it. HDF 5 should allow a user to extract only one group from a file stored in a SRB system. I doubt that it would be very practical to catalogue the data so finely, at least not at a facility level. This definition assumes an indexing at the file level. 

Part of the definition are optional parameters for information that are highly recommended but not required . It is build with RAW file in mind. other parameters may be needed for processed / result or simulation files

== Multiple NXentry issue ==

In the case of archiving and cataloguing, multiple NXentry make it difficult to extract metadata to characterize a file, (e.g. 1 file with multiple samples in multiple NXentry?). 

Only the metadata from the first NXentry will be used in the indexing of the NeXus file.  
The first NXentry will be named 'Header' or '{name}_0' where name c an be any string (e.g. 'scan_0') or will contain the following tag with a value of 0.
<pre>
  <NXentry>
    <entry_num type="NX_INT"> {entry number starting from 0}? </entry_num>
  </NXentry>
</pre>
