The actual ''NXaperture'' base class is far to complex for most of the apertures used at synchrotron facilities. Currently the most commonly used apperture types are 
* pinholes
* 2 or 4 blade slits.
From the current implementation of NXaperture it would be rather difficult to obtain relevant quantities like the size of the slit gap or the offsets of the gap. 
There are basically two ways how to face this problem
* redesign ''NXaperture''
* or introduce new classes for more specific aperture types.
Which of them is appropriate for us should be the topic of this discussion.

== Introducing new classes ==

==== Pinholes - ''NXpinhole'' ====
[[Image:Pinhole_2D.png|frame|right|A pinhold in the beam.]]
Pinholds are most probably the simplest apertures available. The only parameter of importance is the diameter of the pinhole and its position with respect to the beam (as shown in the image). 
From this sketch one could easily deduce a new class ''NXpinhole'' with the following parameters
<pre>
NXpinhole
  diameter:NX_FLOAT
  x_offset:NX_FLOAT
  y_offset:NX_FLOAT
</pre>


==== Slits - ''NXslit'' ====
