The actual ''NXaperture'' base class is far t0o complex for most of the apertures used at synchrotron facilities. Currently the most commonly used aperture types are 
* pinholes
* 2 or 4 blade slits.
From the current implementation of ''NXaperture'' it would be rather difficult to obtain relevant quantities like the size of the slit gap or the offsets of the gap. 
There are basically two ways how to face this problem
* redesign ''NXaperture''
* or introduce new classes for more specific aperture types.
Which of them is appropriate for us should be the topic of this discussion.

== Introducing new classes ==

==== Pinholes - ''NXpinhole'' ====
[[Image:pinhole_2.png|upright|frame|right|c|A pinhold in the beam.]]
Pinholes are most probably the simplest apertures available. The only parameter of importance is the diameter of the pinhole and its position with respect to the beam (as shown in the image). 
From this sketch one could easily deduce a new class ''NXpinhole'' with the following parameters:
<pre>
NXpinhole
  diameter:NX_FLOAT
  x_translation:NX_FLOAT
  height:NX_FLOAT
  distance:NX_FLOAT
  depends_on:NX_CHAR
</pre>
The first parameter ''diameter'' describes the diameter of the pinhole while the remaining 
ones describe its position at the experiment. 
The local coordinate system of the pinhole is defined as shown in the figure on the right. All translations are with respect to the origin of this system. The ''depends_on'' field points to a reference object for all geometric transformations. This allows to describe the position of the pinhole either with respect to the beam (by referencing an ''NXbeam'' instance) or with respect to some fixed point at the experiment (for instance the center of rotation of the sample).

==== Slits - ''NXslit'' ====
[[Image:slit.png|frame|right|A four-blade slit system.]]
Two or four blade slits are the most common apertures used at synchrotrons. In this example a 4-blade slit is shown. The most important parameter for such a system is the size of the aperture determined by the positions of the blades. 
A base class ''NXslit'' could look like this
<pre>
NXslit
  x_gap:NX_FLOAT
  y_gap:NX_FLOAT
  x_translation:NX_FLOAT
  height:NX_FLOAT
  distance:NX_FLOAT
  depends_on:NX_CHAR
</pre>
The size of the gap is given in the local reference frame of the slit system. The fields
''x_translation'' and ''distance'' describe the translations of the slits with respect to the object referenced by ''depends_on''.  ''NXslit'' basically describes a rectangular aperture. As the size of the aperture and its position with respect to the beam are the important parameters the positions of the slit blades are not included in the definition of the base class. However, if required they can be stored in an instance of ''NXcollection''.

==== What happens to ''NXaperture''====
The original ''NXaperture'' remains unchanged (for the sake of compatibility) and can still be used for all kind of more complex apertures which cannot  be represented by the the new classes.
