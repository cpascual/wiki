The actual ''NXaperture'' base class is far to complex for most of the apertures used at synchrotron facilities. Currently the most commonly used apperture types are 
* pinholes
* 2 or 4 blade slits.
From the current implementation of NXaperture it would be rather difficult to obtain relevant quantities like the size of the slit gap or the offsets of the gap. 
There are basically two ways how to face this problem
* redesign ''NXaperture''
* or introduce new classes for more specific aperture types.
Which of them is appropriate for us should be the topic of this discussion.
