The actual ''NXaperture'' base class is far to complex for most of the apertures used at synchrotron facilities. Currently the most commonly used apperture types are 
* pinholes
* 2 or 4 blade slits.
From the current implementation of NXaperture it would be rather difficult to obtain relevant quantities like the size of the slit gap or the offsets of the gap. 
There are basically two ways how to face this problem
* redesign ''NXaperture''
* or introduce new classes for more specific aperture types.
Which of them is appropriate for us should be the topic of this discussion.

== Introducing new classes ==

==== Pinholes - ''NXpinhole'' ====
[[Image:pinhole_2.png|upright|frame|right|c|A pinhold in the beam.]]
Pinholds are most probably the simplest apertures available. The only parameter of importance is the diameter of the pinhole and its position with respect to the beam (as shown in the image). 
From this sketch one could easily deduce a new class ''NXpinhole'' with the following parameters
<pre>
NXpinhole
  diameter:NX_FLOAT
  orientation:NXorientation
  translation:NXtranslation
</pre>
The last two paramters determine the offset of the pinhole center to the incident beam. The local coordinate system of the pinhole is defined as shown in the figure on the right. All translations and rotations are with respect to the origin of this system.

==== Slits - ''NXslit'' ====
[[Image:slit.png|frame|right|A four-blade slit system.]]
Two or four blade slits are the most common apertures used at synchrotrons. In this example a 4-blade slit is shown. The most important parameter for such a system is the size of the aperture determined by the positions of the blades. 
A base class ''NXslit'' could look like this
<pre>
NXslit
 x_gap:NX_FLOAT
 y_gap:NX_FLOAT
 blades: NXgeometry
</pre>
The size of the gap is given in the local reference frame of the slit system.

==== What happens to ''NXaperture''====
The original ''NXaperture'' remains unchanged (for the sake of compatability) and can still be used for all kind of more complex apertures which cannot  be represented by the the new classes.
