==Facilities currently using the NeXus data format==

===Neutron Scattering Facilities===

;ISIS Neutron Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK: Instruments on the [http://ts-2.isis.rl.ac.uk/ ISIS second target station] are now generating NeXus files as per the [[TOFRaw]] definition in parallel with old ISIS RAW format files. Currently most data analysis is carried out using the ISIS RAW files, but the new [http://www.mantidproject.org/ Mantid data analysis framework] supports [[TOFRaw]] NeXus files and is being increasingly used. The long term goal is to entirely replace the old ISIS RAW file format on both the first and second target stations with NeXus files; the rate determining step for this is the updating of data analysis code to read NeXus files.

===Pulsed Muon Facilities===
;ISIS Muon Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK: The [http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/ ISIS facility] has been producing and using NeXus files on its [http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/muons/ muon spectrometers] for many years now (see [[Muon_Time_Differential]] definition). The current definition is in the process of being updated to allow it to store more complex experiments and also to make it more similar to the [[TOFRaw]] definition used on the ISIS neutron instruments.

===X-ray Facilities===

;Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, US: APS has been generating NeXus-compatible (HDF4) files for many years as an option from the <tt>CCDImageServer</tt> software used by the Tomography instrument at 2-BM and others. Each Tomo experiment generates on order of 1,000 files.  During a three-month operations cycle, it is common to generate of order 1,000,000 files.  Data reduction of the Tomo files proceeds from the HDF4 files. Use of the NeXus-compatible format is discretionary for other users of the <tt>CCDImageServer</tt> software (the alternative choice is TIFF with metadata stored external to the TIFF files).  As APS replaces <tt>CCDImageServer</tt> with newer EPICS software (<tt>areaDetector</tt> and a GUI), it is expected to retain and improve the support for the NeXus format, as required by and best serves the APS user community.  The microdiffraction instrument at 34ID-E is considering NeXus HDF5 files for the storage of their experimental results.  This may prove a challenge as the instrument expects to stream 5 MB images at 20 frames/second on a continuous basis; it may not be practical to store and retain all the raw data.
