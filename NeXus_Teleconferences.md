These were born out of the idea of opening the meetings of the
[Technical Subcommittee](Technical_Subcommittee "wikilink") to the wider
community. All interested parties are welcome.

Currently we use Google Hangout as the technology, which works
reasonably well for everyone. (Google account required obviously.) The
link for that will be
<https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/g2pa6t2hnwkox4jgjl2p72nqkea>

We aim to publish and agenda a few days in advance of the meetings. The
link to the meeting should be put on the meeting page as well.
