The NeXus Design page lists the group classes from which a NeXus file is
constructed. They provide the glossary of items that could, in
principle, be stored in a standard-conforming NeXus file (other items
may be inserted into the file if the author wishes, but they won't be
part of the standard). If you are going to include a particular piece of
metadata, consult the class definitions to find out what to call it.
However, to assist those writing data analysis software, it is useful to
provide more than a glossary; it is important to define the required
contents of NeXus files that contain data from particular classes of
neutron, x-ray, or muon instrument.

As part of the NeXus standard, we have identified a number of generic
instruments that describe an appreciable number of existing instruments
around the world. Although not identical in every detail, they share
enough common characteristics, and more importantly, they require
sufficiently similar modes of data analysis, to make a standard
description useful. They are in the process of being defined for the
NeXus standard. The definitions will be in XML using the NeXus Meta-DTD
format.
