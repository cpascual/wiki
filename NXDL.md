NXDL: NeXus Definition Language
===============================

NXDL is the new NeXus definition language - it will replace the
[Meta-DTD format](Metaformat "wikilink") as the way for specifying the
content of NeXus data files. NXDL is based on XML schema technology and
follows on from provisional work on [NeXus schema](Schema "wikilink") in
Summer 2008.

At NIAC 2008 it was agreed that writing definitions directly as schema
would probably be too verbose and instead a new language (NXDL) was
devised that would then be translated into XML schema for eventual
validation. The files written in the NXDL language are XML files in
their own right and have an associated XML schema - this means a
schema-aware XML editor can be used and accurate definition creation is
much easier than it was with the old Meta-DTD.

For the latest NXDL definitions see the [svn
repository](http://trac.nexusformat.org/definitions/browser/trunk)
