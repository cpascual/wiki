Greg Sonnenfeld

I am currently a senior at NMSU in the engineering physics department working for Dr. Urquidi on a new graphical interface for X-ray Diffraction for IsomerX. Being that the software I am currently writing will be using the neXus format, I find it compelling to participate in the Nexus format discussion.

About me:

Prior to becoming a physics engineering major, I spent a good deal of time in the IT / CS bussiness working on web applications and OOP. I've been programming in C and C++ since 1995, and passed the Comuter Science AP AB exam in 1998 at the age of 16. In 2000, I took a job with an IT company that supported networks and web services.

In 2002, I entered the CS department at NMSU. In 2003, despite doing very well in CS, I became disinterested in the field and changed my major to Engineering physics. Since then i have worked on several software engineering projects, the latest being IsomerX.
