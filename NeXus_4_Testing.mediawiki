This page will be used to record the results of testing for NeXus 4.0. The appropriate kit should be downloaded and then the result of the test recorded here. The table should record:
* The operating system and version
* The name of the tester
* The file formats picked up by configure (HDF4/HDF5/XML)
* The result of a "make check"
* Any other problems

Please file bug reports into the [[IssueReporting]] system and indicate the version of the kit being tested
