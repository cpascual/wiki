== Inheritance ==

e.g. define NXarea_detector and NXpoint_detector as inheriting from NXdetector; the API would need to have knowledge of the inheritance hierarchy so that the function '''getnext("NXdetector")''' would return either an NXarea_detector or NXpoint_detector etc.

Following an inheritance system would allow for clearer definitions
