This group was charged with discussing matters arising from the [[TOFRaw|NXTOFRW  - NeXus Time-of-Flight Raw File Format (simple sit and count case)]] proposal in preparation for a full group discussion.

==Summary of main proposals in [[TOFRaw]]==

# Some new meta-data names in NXentry for archiving and cataloguing of data
# Some thoughts about scans (now moved to [[TOFRawScan|NXTOFRWSC]] and being considered by the [[Scanning Group]])
# General and Area detector specific NXdetector
# Additional options for specifying pixel geometry with area detectors (edges, corners, etc.) 
# New NXdetector_groups class for logically grouping and labelling detector elements
# Representing hardware ganging of detectors

==General, linear and Area detector specific NXdetector==

In all the definitions below we will leave out the Time-of-flight array index as what we are discussing is equally valid for non time-of-flight instruments. One new member of type NXgeometry called '''origin''' is introduced into all NXdetectors - this member is used to define a logical centre of the detector and its [[NXshape]] member defines a bounding box for the whole detector bank/array. If the [[NXgeometry]] instance '''geometry''' within NXdetector is used to specify pixel locations, it should be define positions relative to this detector origin.  

===Inheritance of definitions===

To aid with making definitions clearer we spent some time considereing an inheritance system for NeXus. One method would be to use a period (.) in a class name to denote inheritance and so define classes called NXdetector.area and NXdetector.point which would imply they inherited from NXdetector. The API would need a minor change so that is you asked for '''getnext("NXdetector")''' it would not look for an exact match of this string, but look for any NeXus class that started with the prefix "detector" and so would return either an NXdetector.area or NXdetector.point etc. By using this (.) method the reading API does not need to know about separately about the inheritance structure as it is encoded in the name of the item when it is written by the API.

Though we would not introduce such inheritance into the API at thois instance, it is something that is needed. For the moment we will just have an NXdetector with the '''layout'''  variable indicating the type (area, point or linear)

===NXgeometry revisited===

Before giving the definitions a quick recap of [[NXgeometry]] is in order. This class, through its members [[NXtranslation]], [[NXorientation]] and [[NXshape]], allows the position, orientation and physical extent (size) of an object, or set of objects, to be specified. Translation and orientation can be relative i.e. with respect to an arbitrary origin whihc is just another [[NXgeometry]] object which defines a point in space and a set of default axes directions. When we write NXgeometry[i] in the definitions below we do not mean an array of NXgeometry object (which is not allowed by NeXus) - instead we are using this as shorthand for indexing the '''numobj''' array dimension the [[NXtranslation]], [[NXorientation]] and [[NXshape]] objects within the [[NXgeometry]]

===Type 1: Point Detector ===

A point detector is the most general case and represents a collection of pixels '''i''' over some surface. Within the NXdetector all pixels properties would be indxed by '''i''' e.g.:

* NX_CHAR layout = "point"  (Really an Enum)
* NX_INT counts[i]
* NX_FLOAT polar_angle[i]
* NX_FLOAT distance[i]
* NX_FLOAT solid_angle[i]

If desired, additional information about each pixel (shape, engineering position) can be added via an

* NXgeometry geometry[i] 

instance '''geometry'''. Any detector can be represented by this general case, though in the case of e.g. flat rectangualar detectors it is useful to make use of simplifications introduced by this topology (see below).

===NXdetector.linear===

Here we mean a collection of linear straight strips e.g. tubes. We have two indicies: '''i''' will label the strip/tube and '''j''' the position along the tube. All tubes must have the same number of pixels; if not, you must use the point detector representation above. The tubes do not need to be parallel - they just need to be straight. Thus:
 
* NX_CHAR layout = "linear"
* NX_INT counts[i,j]
* NX_FLOAT polar_angle[i,j]
* NX_FLOAT distance[i,j]
* NX_FLOAT solid_angle[i,j]

So far this just looks like the point detector, but with two array indices. However when we start adding geometry information the differences become clear. As the tubes are straight we need only specify a tube centre and an offset along the tube. Thus

The difference is 
NXgeometry[i] defines tube centre and
pixel_edge[j+1] defines the edges of the pixels - if a pixel_size[j] array is also present it means the pixels have "dead space" between them  

== NXdetector.area ==

NXgeometry defines tube centre
xoffet[i+1] and yoffset[j+1] defines edges of pixels




==Proposals==

# That the new data items in required in NXentry and NXuser for archiving be ratified. [[User:L.lerusse|Laurent Lerusse]] has volunteered to produce a description such that any instruement definition that wishes can "conform to" this.
# That NeXus implement inheritance in definitions and classes by a method yet to be finalised.
