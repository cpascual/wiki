== Inheritance ==

e.g. define NXarea_detector and NXpoint_detector as inheriting from NXdetector; the API would need to have knowledge of the inheritance hierarchy so that the function '''getnext("NXdetector")''' would return either an NXarea_detector or NXpoint_detector etc.

Following an inheritance system would allow for clearer definitions


== NXdetector ==

Three types: NXpoint_detector, NXlinear_detector and NXarea_detector


== NXpoint_detector ==

A collection of pixels '''i''' over some surface. Defined by:

polar_angle[i]
distance[i]
solid_angle[i]

If desired, additional information about pixels (shape, engineering position) can be added via an NXgeometry[i]
