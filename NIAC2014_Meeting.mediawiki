=== Minutes ===

==== Thursday Morning ====

Present members: as above.

Welcome address by John Maclean (Acting Division Director for Engineering Support).

Mark K introduction on activities since last meeting, including code camp. As well as proposed list of topics and agenda. (SLIDES?)

Agenda approved. MARK K to provide here.

New Members approved (all in favour):
* Mark Basham for Diamond
* Tobias Richter for ESS
* Claudio Ferrero for ESRF

NXmx, NXtransformations and variants accepted as proposed (all in favour).

NXgeometry deprecated - manual expresses warning not to use in the future (all in favour).

polar_angle and azimuthal_angle stay unannotated in the manual (1 abstain, 1 against).

CIF style marked as preferred method for expressing geometry in the manual (1 abstain).

Presentation on multidimensional axes by Pete Jemian. 

Coffee break.

Vote on proposal for NXdata axes with indices attribute only required when required to resolve ambiguity. All in favour.
Vote on proposal with indices required as in [[2014_axes_and_uncertainties]]. Accepted: 9 in favour. Strong disagreement by Ray Osborn as adoption is noted: "Adoption of NeXus will be hampered by additional complexity being required unnecessarily". Ben Watts would like to add that the default plot in NXdata should be simple and not contain more data than required. He may make a proposal at that end in future.

Eugen clarified the preference to use arrays where possible to avoid string parsing. No objections. Proposal amended.

Pete Jemian presenting proposal for uncertainties. No agreement on best way forward. All three possibilities (''field''_uncertainties, attribute to field, and attribute to parent group) all have pros and cons. We reserve all schemes and explore further. NIAC will see a proposal when experience has been gained with all variations.

Lunch

==== Thursday afternoon ====

Ratification of new and amended base classes and definitions.

NXfluo [[Update_for_NXflou_application_definition]] Resolution: Proposal is in agreement with existing scan rules. No vote required. Further amendments to the application definition may be required, but that needs to be refined. Mark B and Eugen W will work on that.

NXapres: Unanimously accepted in the current form in contributed_definitions.
