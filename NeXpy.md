NeXpy provides a high-level Python interface to NeXus data contained
within a simple GUI. It is designed to provide an intuitive interactive
toolbox allowing users both to access existing NeXus files and to create
new NeXus-conforming data structures without expert knowledge of the
file format.

Installation
------------

NeXpy is in the early stages of development, and so there has been no
stable release yet. However, it is available for testing purposes only.
To check out the latest version from the
[Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repository and install the
NeXpy package to the standard Python site-packages directory,:

`> hg clone `[`http://mercurial.mcs.anl.gov/repos/nexpy`](http://mercurial.mcs.anl.gov/repos/nexpy)  
`> cd nexpy`  
`> python setup.py install`  
`> nexpy`  

This assumes that the standard Python script directory is in your
default path.

The source code can also be viewed on the [NeXpy Trac
Server](http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/nexpy/).
