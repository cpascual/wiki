Greg Sonnenfeld

I am currently a senior at NMSU in the engineering physics department
working for Dr. Urquidi on a new graphical interface for X-ray
Diffraction for IsomerX. Being that the software I am currently writing
will be using the neXus format, I find it compelling to participate in
the Nexus format discussion.
