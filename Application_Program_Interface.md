The Application Program Interface (API) has been developed to facilitate
the reading and writing of NeXus files. The API supports the reading and
writing of HDF4, HDF5, and, since version 3.0.0, XML files. The core
routines have been written in C but wrappers are available for a number
of other languages including Fortran 77, Fortran 90, Java, and IDL.
