===Meeting layout===

The format of the last meeting at Santa Fe was very
productive, and so similar break-out group meeting
rooms are envisaged at this meeting.  Such groups might be

'''technical         programming the api'''

'''instruments-1     3-axis/reflection/[[SAS]]/polarised/muons '''
* (step-scanning/multi-detector/X-ray/neutron)
* examples...
* update definitions
* prototype treated data

'''instruments-2     TOF inelastic/TOF Powder diffraction'''
* (Principally multi-detector neutron instruments)
* experts from completed instruments offer feedback to the remainder
* example data
* update definitions
* prototype treated data 1D,2D data
* rebinning, constant (Q,w)

'''[[Synchrotron_Group]] (A. Goetz)'''
* this group will meet separately on the second and third days, and may be expected to offer objective feedback         and criticism on the NeXus project from their fresh point of view.

It will be possible, too, to find additional space if other specific interest groups wish to meet separately.

We should designate a publication sub-committee to write a report for Synchrotron Radiation News and Neutron News 

The problem of regular finance of NIAC activities has been posed to the ILL directors, and one is invited  to the opening of
the meeting.
