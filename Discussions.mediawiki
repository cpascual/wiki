The NeXus wiki is a collaborative forum that allows members of the neutron, x-ray, and muon communities to make contributions to the development of the NeXus format. We invite you to browse through any of the discussions and edit them accordingly. We only ask that you read a few simple guidelines before making any changes.

;[[Documentation issues]]:A forum for discussing how the NeXus format should be documented.
