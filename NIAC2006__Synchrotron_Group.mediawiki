== Nexus – Synchrotron breakout group ==

These are notes from our first discussion on 2006-02-01


present : AG (ESRF), RW (ESRF), PJ (APS), CM (Soleil), SP (Soleil), SC (Diamond), LL (ISIS)

RW – ESRF has their own format but willing to adopt

PJ – need an international collaborative effort, EPICS low level

SP – Soleil has adopted Nexus, need tools, developed a tango generic system store data in Nexus, NO DATA to store yet, need to start quickly to store data, do not need a complete DTD

SC – committed to Nexus, MX beamlines will store imageCIF, prefer to store data in Nexus in the long term, EPICS low level simulators, simple classes to start with

LL – working on catalogue information, TOF meta-data definition, data portal to access different type of data for modelled and measured data

PJ – basic questions about which class contains which ?

===Questions===

#Can we have NX_BOOLEAN ?
#Do we have to use microamp units for current ?
#Why is NXmonitor not NXdata ?

===IDEAS===

NXbeam_position_monitor could be a separate class (subclass of NXlog) ?
