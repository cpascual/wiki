Friday, July 15, 2005:The technical committee is pleased to announce the official release of [version 3.0.0 of the NeXus API](http://www.nexus.anl.gov/nexus_api.html#download). Mark Koennecke has incorporated infrastructure permitting the use of XML as an additional data format in the same way that it is already possible to switch between HDF4 and HDF5. The same API calls will be used for all underlying formats so that their use will be transparent to the calling program.

The distribution now includes [Peter
Peterson's](User%3APfpeterson "wikilink")
[NXtranslate](NXtranslate "wikilink") utility to map data in existing
files to NeXus format via XML “translation files”. This application will
aid developers to write NeXus reading applications by converting real
data in a facility-native format to the NeXus standard.

In addition a [bugzilla server](http://nexus.isis.rl.ac.uk/) has been
established as a clearinghouse for bug reports and feature requests.

Thursday, June 23, 2005:The NeXus wiki is born. It uses the MediaWiki software that powers [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and is much more flexible than the [Swiki](http://www.neutron.anl.gov:8080/NeXus) we have been using until now.  
Thursday, March 17, 2005:The next meeting of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) will be held April 26-28 at the [Bishop's Lodge](http://www.bishopslodge.com/) in Sante Fe, NM. The main task during these three days is to create instrument definitions.
