The NeXus wiki is a collaborative forum that allows members of the
neutron, x-ray, and muon communities to make contributions to the
development of the [NeXus format](http://www.nexus.anl.gov/). We invite
you to browse through the pages listed below, and, if you have a
constructive suggestion, edit them accordingly. We only ask that you
read a few simple [guidelines](Help:Guidelines "wikilink") before making
any changes.

-   [NeXus Classes](Classes "wikilink") - definitions of the base
    classes that make up NeXus files
-   [NeXus Instrument Definitions](Instruments "wikilink") - generic
    instrument definitions or other specialized uses of NeXus
-   [NeXus Software](Software "wikilink") - forum for disussing the API
    and other software issues
-   [NeXus Documentation](Documentation "wikilink") - forum for
