The NeXus wiki is configured so that people have to be logged in before editing a page.  Since we can verify who made a particular edit by looking at the page's history, I propose that we use the wiki for future votes by the [[NIAC]].  Here is the mechanism:
# The '''Article''' page is used to make a proposal, record an XML definition, provide documentation, ''etc''.
# The '''Discussion''' page is used to discuss what is contained in the '''Article''' page.
# After a reasonable period for discussion, the executive secretary or other member of the NIAC proposes a motion based on the preceding discussion, at the end of the '''Discussion''' page.
# After the motion, there are separate sub-headings marked '''Yes''', '''No''', and '''Abstain'''.
# Each NIAC member adds their signature below the sub-heading representing their vote.  They should vote by typing on a new line <nowiki>:~~~~</nowiki>.  The colon ensures that the vote is formatted on a new line, while the <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> records the committee members username and the time of entry.

Here is an example motion (the real one will be on this page's '''Discussion""" page):
