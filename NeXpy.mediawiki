NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to NeXus data contained within a simple GUI. It is designed to provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both to access existing NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data structures without expert knowledge of the file format.  

==Installation==
NeXpy is in the early stages of development, and so there has been no stable release yet. However, it is available for testing purposes only. To check out the latest version from the [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Mercurial] repository and install the NeXpy package to the standard python site-packages directory,:
 > hg clone http://mercurial.mcs.anl.gov/repos/nexpy
 > cd nexpy
 > python setup.py install
  
This assumes that the standard Python script directory is in your default path. 

The source code can also be viewed on the [http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/nexpy/ NeXpy Trac Server].

==Running NeXpy==
There are two ways of using the NeXpy interface to NeXus files.
# Within a standard python or ipython shell. 
 # Using the GUI shell

===Python Shell===
 >nexpy rosborn$ python
 Python 2.5.4
 [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc.)] on darwin
 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 >>> import nexus
 >>> a=nexus.load('data/chopper.nxs')

===GUI Shell===
To run the NeXpy GUI, type
 > nexpy

There are a number of useful features available when running NeXpy within the GUI shell. 
# Data can be loaded with the File:Open menu item using a standard file browser window.
# All current NeXus data trees are easy to inspect in the pane on the upper left side. Hovering over a data item produces a tooltip containing a list of all the item's children. 
# The root level of all newly created groups are automatically displayed in the tree.
# Any changes to data sets in the scripting window will be reflected within the tree pane, including the creation of new NXroot, NXentry, or NXdata groups.
# NXdata and NXmonitor plots can be displayed by right-clicking and choosing 'Plot'.
# Axis limits are set by a series of slider bars.
# The scripting shell provides convenient autocompletion, and automatically displays function docstrings as a tooltip when you open the function parentheses.
====Planned Enhancements====
* Plotting projections along any axis by dragging and right-clicking the plots.
* Editing data items in the tree within an editor pane.
* Fitting data with predefined and user-supplied functions.
