==NXmeasurement==
This is a proposal for NeXus which comes out of the NeXus for Synchrotrons workshop at PSI


In order to satisfy the requirements of the beamline scientist an additional, simplified 
NeXus hierarchy is proposed:


<pre>
entry:NXentry
   measurement:NXmeasurement
      positions:NXpositioners
      scalars:NXscalar
      images:NXimagedata
</pre>
  
Please note that this is an example how a NXmeasurement group may look like. The general feeling was 
to allow much freedom in NXmeasurement and standardize later on if a common pattern emerges. 
The meaning is that the NXpositioners groups contains a list of all constants and motor positions, 
NXscalar arrays of all parameters varied during the scan and NXimageData the images and other detector data which has been captured 
during a scan or measurement. This structure is for the expert, the instrument scientist, who knows 
his instrument by heart and wishes to be able to plot anything against anything in his instrument. 
NXmeasurement is not meant to stand alone but is to be augmented with further NXsubentries 
containing the data in proper NeXus notation and hierarchy. It was pointed out that such a 
simplified view can be generated by a data analysis application from a full NeXus NXinstrument view.
