Develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those
attending the 2011 NeXus Code Camp will already have strong foundation
and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. The specific projects and tasks, as well as the list of
participants, are described on this wiki and will be revised as the
event draws near.
