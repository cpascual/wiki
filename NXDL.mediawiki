= NXDL: NeXus Definition Language =

NXDL is the new NeXus definition language - it will replace the [[Metaformat|Meta-DTD format]] as the way for specifying the content of NeXus data files. NXDL is based on XML schema technology and follows on from provisional work on [[Schema|NeXus schema]] in Summer 2008. 

At [[Media:NIAC2008_minutes.pdf|NIAC 2008]] it was agreed that writing definitions directly as schema would probably be too verbose and instead a new language (NXDL) was devised that would then be translated into XML schema for eventual validation. The files written in the NXDL language are XML files in their own right and have an associated XML schema - this means a schema-aware XML editor can be used and accurate definition creation is much easier than it was with the old Meta-DTD.

For the latest NXDL definitions see the [http://trac.nexusformat.org/definitions/browser/trunk svn repository]
