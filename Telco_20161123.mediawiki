==Minutes==

Present: MK, HJB, EW, AF, AB, PJ, RO

===Minutes from NIAC===
Generally accepted with minor corrections. All action items should be understood and covered in tickets or already done.

Versioning is ongoing with good progress. A lot of the workflow will smooth out overtime and become clearer with use, we hope.

===Github issues===

Pull request accepted with minor changes.

NXDL contact attribute idea was rejected as detracting from proper forums like mailing lists and NIAC.

Unused attributes: ref and refindex seem to be unused indeed. They should be deprecated now. (and exercise in versioning as well.) 

===pixels as length===

Not a great idea, but follows current practice at experiments. Should be accepted. Will figure out a way to allow that and what the proper unit name for pixels is.

===Postponed Items===
We ran out of time on:

* web site redesign - future of wiki
* Can we rename the <tt>uncertainties</tt> attribute (such as in NXdata) to be the singular <tt>uncertainty</tt>?

They have been put on the next meetings' agenda with some other items that came up.
