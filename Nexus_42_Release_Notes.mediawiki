==System Requirements==
'''MXML XML Parsing Library'''

Version 2.2.2 or higher of mxml is required. Earlier versions have a bug and the XML API will not work. This package can be downloded in [http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/software.php both source and binary rpm form] and is also available as part of [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/UsingExtras Fedora Extras]. IMPORTANT NOTE: Debian also provides the mxml package, but it based on 2.0 and will not work properly.

==Building Notes==
===NAG F90/F95 Compiler===
The NAG compiler needs the '''-mismatch''' flag to be specified or else it will not compile NXmodule.f90 This is achieve by running configure with the '''FCFLAGS''' environment variable set to contain the flag e.g.
<pre>
env FCFLAGS="-mismatch" ./configure --with-f90=f95
</pre>
===HDF4 on Intel Macs===
There is a problem with the include file, hdfi.h (normally in /usr/local/include).  See http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/helparc/software/msg00069.html for details of the modifications necessary to fix it.
