NIAC Meeting - October 2006
---------------------------

The next meeting of the [ NeXus International Advisory
Committee](NIAC "wikilink") will be held at the [Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov) near San Francisco, California,
USA. The meeting will be held from October 5 to 6, 2006, immediately
following [NOBUGS 2006](http://nobugs2006.lbl.gov/).

### List of Attendees

If you are interested in attending (and are not already on the [list of
attendees](NIAC2006LBL_attendees "wikilink")), contact [Andrew
Götz](User%3AAndy_Gotz "wikilink").

### Start of the Meeting

-   You are responsible for your own breakfast and travel to the lab. In
    theory there are many people staying at the DoubleTree and the
    Durant so carpooling is encouraged.
-   Arrive at the badging office and they will give you a visitor badge
    and a “blue triangle” parking pass. For those of you without a car
    there is a lab shuttle bus that will take you from there to building
    two (2).
-   We will be starting at 8:30 am (pacific time) in building two (2)
    room 100B. This is the biggest room and will be where refreshments
    are served.

### Agenda

#### Proposed Agenda Items

Please add suggestions for agenda items here in [ bullet
form](Help:Editing#Lists "wikilink"). If you want to add extended
comments concerning any agenda item, please use the Wiki's talk page [
Talk Page](Talk:NIAC_Meetings "wikilink").

-   Moving from [Meta-DTDs](Metaformat "wikilink") to XML Schema. see
    [NeXML proposal](http://www.webel.com.au/nexml)
-   Discuss NeXus collaborating with imgCIF. see [MEDSBIO
    proposal](http://www.medsbio.org/)
-   Request institutes from the NeXus community sponsor a full-time
    technical secretary for next 12-24 months.
-   Institutes that write NeXus files are **data providers.**. NeXus
    provides an interface between **data providers** and **data
    requirers**. Discuss if the NIAC constitution should be change to
    allow data requirers e.g. DANSE to have representation on the NIAC
    as a stakeholder that requires NeXus.

#### API/Technical Issues

-   Improving NeXus internal code documention on private structures and
    functions. Only API developer needs to know about these, but at the
    moment the knowledge is restricted to a few people. The existing
    in-code documentation needs to be tidied up and it would be a good
    idea if programs such as
    [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) could
    parse it.

<!-- -->

-   Simplifying Nexus to increase its adoption for analysis programs.
    Proposal by ILL+ESRF

<!-- -->

-   Move from the current [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) (for version
    control) / [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/) (for bugs/issues)
    system to using [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) /
    [TRAC](http://trac.edgewall.org/). Freddie has set up two sites at
    [<http://svn.nexusformat.org>](http://svn.nexusformat.org) and
    [<http://trac.nexusformat.org>](http://trac.nexusformat.org) for
    testing
