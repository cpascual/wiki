* TOFRaw is doing 90% of what is needed
** Add data_error

* Missing items for data binning
** time_focusing_type (e.g. difc, cubic, ..)
** time_focusing_parameters [ndetector,nparameters]
** Deadtime correction information (in combination with gang_..)

* Missing items for Rietveld refinement
** Profile types and starting parameters
** Incident spectrum (parameters or run in NXcharacterization)
