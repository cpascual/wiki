The NeXus wiki is a collaborative forum that allows members of the
neutron, x-ray, and muon communities to help in the development of the
NeXus format. We invite you to browse through any of the discussions and
contribute to them. We only ask that you read a [few simple
guidelines](Help:Contents "wikilink") before making any changes.

[Design Issues](Design_Issues "wikilink"): A forum for discussing any aspect of the NeXus design - the class hierarchy, structure, object linking, *etc*.  
[Software issues](Software_issues "wikilink"):A forum for discussing the NeXus API and other software issues.  
[Documentation issues](Documentation_issues "wikilink"):A forum for discussing how the NeXus format should be documented.  
[Miscellaneous topics](Miscellaneous_topics "wikilink"):A forum for discussing anything else.  
[NIAC Meetings](NIAC_Meetings "wikilink"):A forum for discussing the agenda of future NIAC meetings.
