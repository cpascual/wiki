== Teleconferences ==

These were born out of the idea of opening the meetings of the [[Technical Subcommittee]] to the wider community. All interested parties are welcome. 

Currently we use Google Hangout as the technology, which works reasonably well for everyone. (Google account required obviously.) 

We aim to publish and agenda a few days in advance of the meetings. The link to the meeting should be put on the meeting page as well.
