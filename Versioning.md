Versioning
----------

This topic is about having different version number schemes for the
NeXus-API and the Meta-DTD definitions.

There are two options:

-   Keep DTD's in nexus-api cvs tree and be careful when tagging
-   Two different repositories to prevent accidental versioning tagging

NIAC 2006, ILL: separate versioning for DTD and NAPI.
