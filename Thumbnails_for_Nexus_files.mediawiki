Thumbnails that a file browser (or even a web browser) can use to render a Nexus file shall be stored in an instance 
of NXlog directly below NXentry
<pre>
entry:NXentry
  thumbnail:NXnote
    data:NX_BINARY
    type:NX_CHAR
    description:NX_CHAR
</pre>
The data field contains the binary data of the thumbail image. The image type is determined by the type field. 
We currently recommend the image to be stored as PNG. 
The description field can be used to store provenance data which may show up as a tool-tip when the mouse pointer hovers over the 
files icon.
