Agenda

Both meetings are taking place in building 437, conference room C010,
starting at 9am. Evening meal is scheduled for 7pm each day

### NeXus Code Camp

The code camp allows existing NeXus developers to meet and work together
on developing software or resolving particular NeXus design issues. A
preliminary list of items is listed below, but the exact subset is
decided on the first day of the meeting.

### NIAC Meeting

This is a meeting for members of the NeXus International Advisory
committee and other interested persons. It generally discusses matters
of policy and strategy, but can discuss specific NeXus instrument
definitions if the relevant experts are in attendance.

-   Electing new officers, candidates get ready!
-   Ratification of joint CIF/NeXus application definition
-   Deprecation of NeXus polar coordinate system, NXgeometry?
-   Do we want better standardization and documentation of NeXus
    processes?
-   Discussion about how we assign priorities and respond to the
    community
-   Do we want NeXus Interfaces for improving base class documentation?
-   Lightweight tags versus application definitions?
-   Rules for multi file NeXus files
-   Once again: discuss assigning axes to data
-   Decide on NXpoise
-   NXformula
-   Are some contributions from the contributions directory ratifiable?
