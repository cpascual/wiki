starting at 9am. Evening meal is scheduled for 7pm each day

### NeXus Code Camp

The code camp allows existing NeXus developers to meet and work together
on developing software or resolving particular NeXus design issues. A
preliminary list of items is listed below, but the exact subset is
decided on the first day of the meeting.

-   Discuss NeXus interfaces
-   NXformula
-   Rules for multi file NeXus files
-   NXvalidate: state, further development, WWW service
-   Assigning axes to data once more again
-   Prepare things from the contributions directory for ratification
-   Discuss lightweight tags versus application definitions
-   The namespace pollution problem
-   Discuss NeXus processes
-   highlight optional contents in application definitons in manual
-   new NAPI release?
-   finish support for attribute arrays

### NIAC Meeting

This is a meeting for members of the NeXus International Advisory
committee and other interested persons. It generally discusses matters
of policy and strategy, but can discuss specific NeXus instrument
definitions if the relevant experts are in attendance.

-   Electing new officers, candidates get ready!
-   Ratification of application definitions and base classes from
    contrib: joint CIF/NeXus NXmx, NXarpes, NXcite, NXtransformations,
    etc
-   Deprecation of NeXus polar coordinate system, NXgeometry?
-   Do we want better standardization and documentation of NeXus
    processes?
-   Discussion about how we assign priorities and respond to the
    community
-   Do we want NeXus Interfaces for improving base class documentation?
-   Lightweight tags versus application definitions?
-   Rules for multi file NeXus files
-   Once again: discuss assigning axes to data
-   NXformula
