Discuss if the NIAC constitution should be change to allow data requirers e.g. DANSE to have representation on the NIAC as a stakeholder that requires NeXus.

====API/Technical Issues====
* Improving NeXus internal code documention on private structures and functions. Only API developer needs to know about these, but at the moment the knowledge is restricted to a few people. The existing in-code documentation needs to be tidied up and it would be a good idea if programs such as [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html Doxygen] could parse it.
