===Start of the Meeting===

* You are responsible for your own breakfast and travel to the lab. In theory there are many people staying at the DoubleTree and the Durant so carpooling is encouraged.
* Arrive at the badging office and they will give you a visitor badge and a "blue triangle" parking pass. For those of you without a  car there is a lab shuttle bus that will take you from there to building two (2).
* We will be starting at 8:30 am (pacific time) in building two (2) room 100B. This is the biggest room and will be where refreshments are served.

===Working Groups===

====API/Technical Issues====
* Improving NeXus internal code documention on private structures and functions. Only API developer needs to know about these, but at the moment the knowledge is restricted to a few people. The existing in-code documentation needs to be tidied up and it would be a good idea if programs such as [http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html Doxygen] could parse it.
* [[Proposal to Simplify Nexus]] to increase its adoption for analysis programs. Proposal by ILL+ESRF
* Move from the current [http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ CVS] (for version control) / [http://www.bugzilla.org/ Bugzilla] (for bugs/issues) system to using [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] / [http://trac.edgewall.org/ TRAC]. Freddie has set up two sites at [http://svn.nexusformat.org http://svn.nexusformat.org] and [http://trac.nexusformat.org http://trac.nexusformat.org] for testing
* Move mailing list to nexusformat.org
* Determine location to store definitions
* Design and implement a way to deal with having approved definitions and a way to modify a working copy on the website
