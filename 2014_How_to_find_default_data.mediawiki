One of the [http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/motivations.html  motivations] for NeXus is [http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/motivations.html#simpleplotting  simple plotting].

The [http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/datarules.html#find-plottable-data procedure to find the default to be plotted] is convoluted.  In some cases (files with multiple NXentry and/or NXdata groups), it is not certain which data will be found.

This proposal is to add a new and simpler mechanism to determine the path to the default data.  The intent is that this addition to NeXus preserves backwards compatibility and becomes the standard way for new data files to identify the default data to be plotted.
