One of the [[http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/motivations.html  motivations] for NeXus is [[http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/motivations.html#simpleplotting  simple plotting]].

The method to find the default to be plotted is convoluted.  In some cases (files with multiple NXentry and/or NXdata groups), it is not certain which data will be found.

This proposal is to add a new and simpler method to determine the path to the default data.
