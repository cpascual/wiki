=Small Items=
==Axis attributes on fields==
The current documentation describes that the fastest varying dimension is annotated with "axis=1". In practice the slowest varying dimension is "axis=1".
==Detector dimensions and array dimensions==
==Geometry order of operations==
When looking at a geometry is the orientation applied before the translation or the other way around.
==[[XESraw]]==
==modify NXmonitor==
Add "current" (units: mA) to NXmonitor "mode" field to represent a normalization against the X-ray storage ring current or X-ray tube operating current.

=Later=
* sequencing entries and measurements
*counting time for each data point
** Does this belong to some base class?
** Which one?
* implement a versioning system
** switch to subversion
** use SVN tagging system
