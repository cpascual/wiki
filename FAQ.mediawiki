== How many facilities use NeXus==
This is continually evolving. It has been used as the instrument format for several years on some or all instruments at a number of facilities including PSI (Switzerland), LLB (France), and LANSCE (USA). It will be used on all future instrumentation at ISIS (UK), NIST (USA), and instruments using the new data acquisition system at IPNS (USA). Finally, it has been formally adopted by two major facilities under construction, the SNS (USA) and JPARC (Japan).
