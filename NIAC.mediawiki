== Constitution ==
=== Terms of Reference ===
The purpose of the NeXus International Advisory Committee is to supervise the development and maintenance of the NeXus common data format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. This purpose includes, but is not limited to, the following activities.
#To establish policies concerning the definition, use, and promotion of the NeXus format.
#To ensure that the specification of the NeXus format is sufficiently complete and clear for its use in the exchange and archival of neutron, x-ray, and muon data.
#To receive and examine all proposed amendments and extensions to the NeXus format. In particular, to ratify proposed application definitions and base classes, to ensure that the data structures conform to the basic NeXus specification, and to ensure that the definitions of data items are clear and unambiguous and conform to accepted scientific usage.
#To ensure that documentation of the NeXus format is sufficient, current, and available to potential users both on the internet and in other forms.
#To coordinate with the developers of the NeXus Application Programming Interface to ensure that it supports the use of the NeXus format in the neutron, x-ray, and muon communities, and to promote other software development that will benefit users of the NeXus format.
#To coordinate with other organizations that maintain and develop related data formats to ensure maximum compatibility.

The committee will meet at least once every calendar year according to the following plan:
* In years coinciding with the NOBUGS series of conferences (once every two years), members of the entire NIAC will meet as a satellite meeting to NOBUGS, along with interested members of the community.
* In intervening years, the executive officers of the NIAC will attend, along with interested members of the NIAC.  This is intended to be a working meeting with a small group.

=== Membership ===
The NeXus International Advisory Committee will seek balanced representation of the international community. It will consist of at most one voting representative from each major neutron, synchrotron x-ray, and muon facility.
Membership would normally be for a three year renewable term. Members will be nominated by each facility through the facility director and approved by the existing committee. Each member can appoint a substitute to attend a particular meeting.

The committee reserves the right to appoint additional members for a limited period to ensure balanced representation.

=== Organization ===
;Accountability:The NeXus International Advisory Committee will ensure that their decisions are reported both on the NeXus web site and on the NeXus mailing list. Committee business will be conducted either through a mailing list, to which non-committee members can subscribe and whose archive will be available on the web, or through meetings, which will be advertised on the NeXus mailing list and which non-committee members may attend.
:The NeXus International Advisory Committee will have the following executive officers:
:* Chair to oversee committee deliberations
:* Executive Secretary to coordinate meetings and online debates. The person that holds the position does not need to be an existing member of the NIAC, and does not vote unless he/she is a regular member.
:* Technical Manager with the responsibility to oversee the NeXus API. The tasks of the manager are to coordinate tests, manage and announce releases, and promote code from the contributed directory to the regular release build.  The person that holds the position does not need to be an existing member of the NIAC, and does not vote unless he/she is a regular member.
:* Definition Release Manager with the responsibility to oversee the release of NeXus definitions and documentation.  The person that holds the position does not need to be an existing member of the NIAC, and does not vote unless he/she is a regular member.
:All of these officers will be elected for a two year term. The incumbent chair and executive secretary are limited to two consecutive terms.
;Voting:Only members of the NeXus International Advisory Committee will be able to vote on specific proposals that come under the remit of the committee. However, all debates will be conducted publicly and non-committee members are both allowed and encouraged to participate.
:Topics voted on will require a simple majority unless specifically challenged by a committee member. In the event of a challenge, the issue will be presented to the NeXus mailing list inviting comments for a period of one month. At the end of this period, the challenge can be overruled by a two thirds majority.
:The constitution can only be changed by a two thirds majority of the NIAC.
;Special Interest Groups:The NeXus International Advisory Committee will appoint editors to be in charge of particular groups that wish to specify instrument definitions or develop specialized uses of the NeXus format. The groups will establish their own mode of operation, but will be expected to consult widely with the community relevant to their work, and to refer back to the NeXus International Advisory Committee any matters that involve a change in the current NeXus specification. Specific proposals produced by these groups will be presented to the NeXus International Advisory Committee for comment and formal ratification.
