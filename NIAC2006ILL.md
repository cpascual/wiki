Meeting rooms are also foreseen in the ESRF annexe close to the CIBB
building.

### Meeting layout

The format of the last meeting at Santa Fe was very productive, and so
similar break-out group meeting rooms are envisaged at this meeting.
Such groups might be

**technical programming the api**

'''instruments-1 3-axis/reflection/SAS/polarised/muons '''

-   (step-scanning/multi-detector/X-ray/neutron)
-   examples...
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data

**instruments-2 TOF inelastic/TOF Powder diffraction**

-   (Principally multi-detector neutron instruments)
-   experts from completed instruments offer feedback to the remainder
-   example data
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data 1D,2D data
-   rebinning, constant (Q,w)

**Synchrotron specialists (A. Goetz)**

-   this group will meet separately on the second and third days, and
    may be expected to offer objective feedback and criticism on the
    NeXus project from their fresh point of view.

It will be possible, too, to find additional space if other specific
interest groups wish to meet separately.

We should designate a publication sub-committee to write a report for
Synchrotron Radiation News and Neutron News

The problem of regular finance of NIAC activities has been posed to the
ILL directors, and one is invited to the opening of the meeting.

`    data files for new, possibly more complex instruments, documentation`  
`    tools and standards, minimal representation of treated data`  
`    (notions of one-step histories, tree display of treatment,`  
`    maximising compatibility of neutron and X-ray data),`  
`    NeXus, HDF, GRIDS and SRBs, `

### NeXus Presentation

Since it is universally agreed that Ron should not give presentations he
suggests that we divide the period amongst several speakers, who might
like to consider (or reject) the task.

-   “From our sponsor” - Ray Osborn (5 minutes) introduction on hopes
    and aspirations

<!-- -->

-   “the platform independent technical challenge” - Przemek Klosowski
    (15 minutes) on self describing data and re-use of software XML
    definitions/HDF or XML packaging of experimental info

<!-- -->

-   “The muon community uses NeXus” - Steve Cottrell (5-10 mins) actual
    advantages achieved.

<!-- -->

-   “killer applications” ? what about a demo of ISAW? what about
    DANSE..? - Ray Osborn (10-15 minutes)

<!-- -->

-   “bringing synchrotrons up to speed and sharing NeXus” - Andy
    Goetz/Stuart Campbell (10 minutes)

<!-- -->

-   “HDF software and utilities a sound and evolving foundation for
    NeXus” - Elena Pourmal (15 minutes)

<!-- -->

    Darren Kelly conclusions... (10 minutes)
