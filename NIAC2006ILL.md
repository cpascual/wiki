NIAC Meeting - February 2006
----------------------------

Ron Ghosh has offered to host the next meeting of the [ NeXus
International Advisory Committee](NIAC "wikilink") in Grenoble, France.

This is the current proposal:

-   Meeting to be held meeting 1-3 February 2006, with accommodation at
    the site guest-house (approx 28 Euros per night bed+breakfast) and a
    contribution towards meals of about 130 Euros per person (3 lunches,
    2 dinners, coffee etc.), based on 20 participants.

<!-- -->

-   We wish to attract external synchrotron observers from SOLEIL,
    Trieste, APS, etc.; it would be useful to offer a “public”
    presentation on one afternoon to the ESRF and the ILL.
