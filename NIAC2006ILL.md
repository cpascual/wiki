### General Information

I would welcome a second party to adapt the following information to the
wiki - this would at least show that a second person has read it!

### Meeting layout

I found the format of the last meeting at Santa Fe was very productive,
and so I have envisaged break-out group meeting rooms with this in mind.
Such groups might be

technical programming the api

instruments-1 3-axis/reflection/SAS/polarised/muons

-   (step-scanning/multi-detector/X-ray/neutron)
-   examples...
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data

instruments-2 TOF inelastic/TOF Powder diffraction

-   (Principally multi-detector neutron instruments)
-   experts from completed instruments offer feedback to the remainder
-   example data
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data 1D,2D data
-   rebinning, constant (Q,w)

Synchrotron specialists (A. Goetz)

-   this group will meet separately on the second and third days, and
    may be expected to offer objective feedback and criticism on the
    NeXus project from their fresh point of view.

It will be possible, too, to find additional space if other specific
interest groups wish to meet separately.

We should designate a publication sub-committee to write a report for
Synchrotron Radiation News and Neutron News

I have posed the problem of regular finance of NIAC activities to the
ILL directors, and invited one to the opening of the meeting.

### NeXus Presentation

The aim is to show that the basic structure is now in place to allow
data sharing and to have common visualisation and data treatment
programs across facilities, and between X-ray and neutron activities. I
will need an agreed abstract perhaps one week before the meeting so it
can be distributed and posted-up at the ESRF and the ILL.

Since it is universally agreed that I should not give presentations I
suggest that we divide the period amongst several speakers, who might
like to consider (or reject) the task.

-   “From our sponsor” - Ray Osborn (5 minutes) introduction on hopes
    and aspirations

<!-- -->

-   “the platform independent technical challenge” - Przemek Klosowski
    (15 minutes) on self describing data and re-use of software XML
    definitions/HDF or XML packaging of experimental info

<!-- -->

-   “The muon community uses NeXus” - Steve Cottrell (5-10 mins) actual
    advantages achieved.

<!-- -->

-   “killer applications” ? what about a demo of ISAW? what about
    DANSE..? - Ray Osborn (10-15 minutes)

<!-- -->

-   “bringing synchrotrons up to speed and sharing NeXus” - Andy
    Goetz/Stuart Campbell (10 minutes)

<!-- -->

-   “HDF software and utilities a sound and evolving foundation for
    NeXus” - Elena Pourmal (15 minutes)

<!-- -->

-   “Where we are today (and tomorrow) with this must-have solution”
    Nick Hauser

conclusions... 10 minutes
