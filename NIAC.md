Constitution
------------

### Terms of Reference

The purpose of the NeXus International Advisory Committee is to
supervise the development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. This purpose includes, but
is not limited to, the following activities.

1.  To establish policies concerning the definition, use, and promotion
    of the NeXus format.
2.  To ensure that the specification of the NeXus format is sufficiently
    complete and clear for its use in the exchange and archival of
    neutron, x-ray, and muon data.
3.  To receive and examine all proposed amendments and extensions to the
    NeXus format. In particular, to ratify proposed instrument and group
    class definitions, to ensure that the data structures conform to the
    basic NeXus specification, and to ensure that the definitions of
    data items are clear and unambiguous and conform to accepted
    scientific usage.
4.  To ensure that documentation of the NeXus format is sufficient,
    current, and available to potential users both on the internet and
    in other forms.
5.  To coordinate with the developers of the NeXus Application
    Programming Interface to ensure that it supports the use of the
    NeXus format in the neutron, x-ray, and muon communities, and to
    promote other software development that will benefit users of the
    NeXus format.
6.  To coordinate with other organizations that maintain and develop
    related data formats to ensure maximum compatibility.

The committee will meet at least once every calendar year.

### Membership

The NeXus International Advisory Committee will seek balanced
representation of the international community. It will consist of at
most one voting representative from each major neutron, synchrotron
x-ray, and muon facility. Membership would normally be for a three year
renewable term. Members will be nominated by each facility through the
facility director and approved by the existing committee. Each member
can appoint a substitute to attend a particular meeting.

The committee reserves the right to appoint additional members for a
limited period to ensure balanced representation.

### Organization

Accountability:The NeXus International Advisory Committee will ensure that their decisions are reported both on the NeXus web site and on the NeXus mailing list. Committee business will be conducted either through a mailing list, to which non-committee members can subscribe and whose archive will be available on the web, or through meetings, which will be advertised on the NeXus mailing list and which non-committee members may attend.  
The NeXus International Advisory Committee will nominate a Chair to
oversee committee deliberations, and appoint an Executive Secretary, who
is not necessarily a member of the committee, to coordinate meetings and
online debates.

Voting:Only members of the NeXus International Advisory Committee will be able to vote on specific proposals that come under the remit of the committee. However, all debates will be conducted publicly and non-committee members are both allowed and encouraged to participate.  
Topics voted on will require a simple majority unless specifically
challenged by a committee member. In the event of a challenge, the issue
will be presented to the NeXus mailing list inviting comments for a
period of one month. At the end of this period, the challenge can be
overruled by a two thirds majority.

The constitution can only be changed by a two thirds majority of the
NIAC.

Special Interest Groups:The NeXus International Advisory Committee will appoint editors to be in charge of particular groups that wish to specify instrument definitions or develop specialized uses of the NeXus format. The groups will establish their own mode of operation, but will be expected to consult widely with the community relevant to their work, and to refer back to the NeXus International Advisory Committee any matters that involve a change in the current NeXus specification. Specific proposals produced by these groups will be presented to the NeXus International Advisory Committee for comment and formal ratification.  

Procedures
----------

### Ratification of Base Classes

The NeXus format is defined as a series of XML files describing both the
base classes and generic instruments that contain a subset of those
classes. It is the role of the NeXus International Advisory Committee to
ratify those base classes, and to approve modifications when they are
proposed. This is the current procedure:

1.  The current version of the base classes shall be kept on the NeXus
    Swiki so that people can post suggested modifications.
2.  The Executive Secretary of the NIAC will review those changes at
    regular intervals, monthly or bimonthly. If in his or her judgement,
    a reasonable proposal has been made, the information will be
    forwarded to the NIAC mailing list for discussion. If the change is
    significant, or has implications for backward compatibility, the
    proposal will also be sent to the NeXus mailing list.
3.  The members of NIAC have one month to make comments concerning the
    proposed changes, after which the Executive Secretary will formulate
    a proposal based both on the original suggestion and the subsequent
    debate, and send it to the mailing list.
4.  This will be voted on by the committee by email. At least two-thirds
    of the committee must vote. Changes will be approved by a majority
    of the whole committee.
5.  The revised classes will then be posted to the NeXus XML CVS server.
