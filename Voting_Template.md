The NeXus wiki is configured so that people have to be logged in before
editing a page. Since we can verify who made a particular edit by
looking at the page's history, I propose that we use the wiki for future
votes by the [NIAC](NIAC "wikilink"). Here is the mechanism:

1.  The **Article** page is used to make a proposal, record an XML
    definition, provide documentation, *etc*.
2.  The **Discussion** page is used to discuss what is contained in the
    **Article** page.
3.  After a reasonable period for discussion, the executive secretary or
    other member of the NIAC proposes a motion based on the preceding
    discussion, at the end of the **Discussion** page.
4.  After the motion, there are separate sub-headings marked **Yes**,
    **No**, and **Abstain**.
5.  Each NIAC member adds their signature below the sub-heading
    representing their vote. They should vote by typing on a new line
    :~~~~. The colon ensures that the vote is formatted on a new line,
    while the ~~~~ records the committee members username and the time
    of entry.

Here is an example motion (the real one will be on this page's
'''Discussion“"” page):
