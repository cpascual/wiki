This is the mechanism for conducting online votes of the
[NIAC](NIAC "wikilink"):

1.  The **Article** page is used to make a proposal, record an XML
    definition, provide documentation, *etc*.
2.  The **Discussion** page is used to discuss what is contained in the
    **Article** page.
3.  After a reasonable period for discussion, the executive secretary or
    other member of the NIAC proposes a motion based on the preceding
    discussion, at the end of the **Discussion** page.
4.  After the motion, there are separate sub-headings marked **Yes**,
    **No**, and **Abstain**.
5.  Each NIAC member adds their
    [signature](Help:Contents#Signatures "wikilink") below the
    sub-heading representing their vote. They should vote by typing on a
    new line :~~~~. The colon ensures that the vote is formatted on a
    new line, while the ~~~~ records the committee members username and
    the time of entry.

Here is an example motion:
