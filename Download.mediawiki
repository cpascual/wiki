==Requirements==
===External Libraries===
Since NeXus uses HDF as the underlying binary format, it is necessary first to install the HDF subroutine libraries and include files before installing the NeXus API. It is not usually necessary to download the HDF source code since precompiled object libraries exist for a variety of operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and various other flavors of Unix. Check the HDF web pages for more information:
*http://www.hdfgroup.org/
Version 3.0.0 of the NeXus API allows the reading and writing of NeXus files in XML. This uses the Mini-XML library, developed by Michael Sweet, which is also available as a precompiled binary library for several operating systems. Please ensure that you install version 2.2.2 or later. Check the Mini-XML web pages for more information:
*http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/

==NeXus Source Code Distribution==

The NeXus API may be built from source using one of the installation kits linked below. 
Depending on which low-level file formats shall be supported, one or several of the following libraries are required:
* libhdf4g
* libhdf5-<subversion?>
* libmxml (note that libmxml1 which comes with some Linux distros is outdated. Use v2.2 from http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml or http://cilibrar.com/~cilibrar/projsup/nex4/)
The compilation uses the GNU Autotools. Download the appropriate gzipped tar file, unpack it, and run the standard configure procedure from the resulting nexus directory. 
<pre>
% tar -zxvf nexus-3.0.0.tar.gz
% cd nexus
% ./configure 
% make
% make install
</pre>
To find out how to customize the installation, ''e.g.'', to choose different installation directories, type
<pre>
% ./configure --help
</pre>
To prevent trouble with unneeded drivers, specify e.g.
<pre>
% ./configure --without-java
</pre>
See the README file for further instructions.

==NeXus Binary Distributions==
===Linux RPM Distribution Kits===
To install and use NeXus you will need to install all of the binary RPMS - these were built on a Fedora Core 2 Linux machine. Install using
<pre>
rpm -Uvh file.i386.rpm
</pre>
or to change installation location from the default area (/usr/local) use
<pre>
rpm -Uvh --prefix /alternative/directory file.i386.rpm
</pre>
If the binary RPMS are not the correct architecture for you (e.g. you need x64 rather than i386), instead download the Source RPM (.src.rpm) and build a binary RPM for you machine using
<pre>
rpmbuild --rebuild file.src.rpm
</pre>
This should then give you a binary RPM file file.something.rpm which you can install as above. Be careful if you think about specifying an alternative buildroot for rpmbuild by using --buildroot option as the "buildroot" directory tree will get remove (so --buildroot / is a really bad idea). Only change buildroot it if the default area turns out not to be big enough to compile the package.

If you are using [http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora Core] Linux, pre-built hdf packages are contained in the fedora-extras repository and can be installed with
<pre>
yum install hdf hdf-devel hdf5 hdf5-devel
</pre>

===Microsoft Windows Install Kit===
[http://download.nexusformat.org/kits/windows/ Windows Installer kits for NeXus]

===CYGWIN Kits===
HDF4 is not supported under CYGWIN - both HDF5 and MXML are supported and can be downloaded and built as usual. When configuring HDF5 you should explicitly pass a prefix to the configure script to make sure the libraries are installed in a "usual" location i.e.
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/hdf5
</pre>
Otherwise you will have to use the '''--with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5''' option later when configuring NeXus to tell it where to look for hdf5. 

After building hdf5, configure and build NeXus using the instructions for [[#NeXus Source Code Distribution| source code distribution]] above.
