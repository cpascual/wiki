==Requirements==
===External Libraries===
Since NeXus uses HDF as the main underlying binary format, it is necessary first to install the HDF subroutine libraries and include files before installing the NeXus API. It is not usually necessary to download the HDF source code since precompiled object libraries exist for a variety of operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and various other flavors of Unix. Check the HDF web pages for more information:
*http://www.hdfgroup.org/
The NeXus API also supports using XML as the underlying on-disk format. This uses the Mini-XML library, developed by Michael Sweet, which is also available as a precompiled binary library for several operating systems. Please ensure that you install version 2.2.2 or later. Check the Mini-XML web pages for more information:
