Items to think about
--------------------

-   TOFRaw is doing 90% of what is needed
    -   Add data\_error

<!-- -->

-   Missing items for data binning
    -   time\_focusing\_type (e.g. difc, cubic, ..)
    -   time\_focusing\_parameters \[ndetector,nparameters\]
    -   Deadtime correction information (in combination with gang\_..)

<!-- -->

-   Missing items for Rietveld refinement
    -   Profile types and starting parameters
    -   Incident spectrum (parameters or run in NXcharacterization)

<!-- -->

-   Other
    -   Binned data - this actually is used in Rietveld.
