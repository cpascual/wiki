==New Features==
The following items are features added to the NeXus API to provide new
functionality to the core library or to assist in the build process.
*Extended XML-API to handle unlimited dimensions
*Add building of Doxygen documentation
*Add support for two dimensional character arrays (HDF4 and HDF5 only)
*Added group attribute support to HDF4 (2006/05/02). Requires HDF4 version (???)
*Add NXmakenamedlink (2007/01/09) to all three file formats (external linking)
*Add NXprintlink
*Improved link testing in test suite
*API can now read generic HDF5 files, such as those produced by matlab
*Add facility to enable/disable error reporting
*New NXsummary tool for summarising contentes of a NeXus file
*Fortran 90 API now works with gfortran 4.2 and above as well as with G95
*PYTHON and TCL bindings provided via a [http://www.swig.org/ SWIG interface]
*Additional NXtranslate translators: SPEC, ESRF-EDF

==Changed Features==
The following aspects of the API have changed in a potentially non-backward compatible way
*The JAVA API now uses org.nexusformat rather than gov.anl.neutron.nexus

==Miscellaneous bug fixes==
The following items are bugs reported in the 3.x releases and resolved for
the 4.0 release.
*Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from char data on a read; this can be disabled by passing the NXACC_NOSTRIP option to NXopen
*Fix problems with MXML (what problems?)
*Improve test procedures when not all libraries are present
*Correct sourcepath for javadoc
*Updated makefiles for swig bindings (python, tcl)

==Upcoming Features==
Work on these features is still in progress. They are expected to be part 
of the NeXus 4.1 release.
*Add skeletal utility functions (NXU) to API (2005/04/26)
