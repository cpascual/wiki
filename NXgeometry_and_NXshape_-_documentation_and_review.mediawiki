== NXgeometry == 
[[Image:Nxgeometry_uml.png | upright | frame | right | c | UML diagramm of the relations between the different geometry related base classes. ]]
Geometries in Nexus are described using the ''NXgeometry'' base class. As shown in the UML diagramm on the right side this class consists basically of three other base classes (composition): ''NXshape'', ''NXtranslation'', and ''NXorientation''.
As far as I understand the ''NXgeometry'' class it describes a single shape (geometric object). This fact makes the dimensionality of several attributes of the the other classes a bit odd (see below).
However, aside from this ''NXgeometry'' is quite ok. 

== NXtranslation == 
Has an attribute ''distances'' of shape <tt>[numobj,3]</tt>. If, as stated above, ''NXgeometry'' seems to describe only a single shape the first dimension has no meaning. A dimensionality of <tt>[3]</tt> would be enough for this field.

== NXorientation == 
Has an attribute ''value'' of shape <tt>[numobj,6]</tt>. If, as stated above, ''NXgeometry'' seems to describe only a single shape the first dimension has no meaning. A dimensionality of <tt>[6]</tt> would be enough for this field.

== NXshape == 
This is where all the problems start. In fact there are three issues with this class

* as for ''NXtranslation'' and ''NXorientation'' the first dimension of the ''size'' attribute (<tt>numobj</tt>) has no meaning
* what is the attribute ''direction'' good for (its values ''convex'' and ''concav'' are not defined)
* last but not least: the shapes are not defined well (this is the major issue)
The last problem will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.

=== Definition of geometric primitives ===
Every geometric primitive requires a local coordinate frame. All translations applied on a primitive will act on the origin of this local frame. 
Additionally, the origin of this frame of reference will act as a center for all rotations applied on the primitive. 
Unfortunately, the 9 geometric primitives currently availbable in Nexus are not defined in such a sens. The following sections provide some possible definitions of these primitives along with the layout of their parameters stored in the ''size'' attribute of ''NXshape''.
