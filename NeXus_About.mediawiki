Neutron and synchrotron facilities around the world came to the conclusion that a common data format would fulfil a valuable function in the scattering community. As instrumentation becomes more complex and data visualization become more challenging, individual scientists, or even institutions, have found it difficult to keep up with new developments. A common data format makes it easier, both to exchange experimental results and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them. It promotes greater cooperation in software development and stimulate the design of more sophisticated visualization tools.

The NeXus data format was developed to meet these goals.  This wiki is used for discussions concerning the development and maintenance of the format.  Please refer to the [http://www.nexus.anl.gov/ NeXus web pages] for official documentation.
