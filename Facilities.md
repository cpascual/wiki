Facilities currently using the NeXus data format
------------------------------------------------

### Neutron Scattering Facilities

ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK: The ISIS facility has been producing and using NeXus files on its Muon spectrometers for many years now (see [Muon\_Time\_Differential](Muon_Time_Differential "wikilink")). Instruments on the ISIS second target station are now generating NeXus files as per the [TOFRaw](TOFRaw "wikilink") definition in parallel with old ISIS RAW format files. Currently most data analysis is carried out using the ISIS RAW files, but the new [Mantid data analysis framework](http://www.mantidproject.org/) supports [TOFRaw](TOFRaw "wikilink") NeXus files and is being increasingly used. The long term goal is to entirely replace the old ISIS RAW file format with NeXus files; the rate determining step for this is the updating of data analysis code to read NeXus files.
