==Travel==
If arriving at Heathrow, take the [http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=24 Oxford "airline" bus], but get off at the penultimate stop [http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/content/img/cms/wtboxfordmap2100512.jpg St Aldates] rather than Oxford bus station. Public transport to Abingdon [http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/content/doc/cms/CityCentre%20120212.pdf leaves from St Aldates] either [http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/main.php?page_id=21 Oxford bus company buses 35 or X3] or [http://www.thames-travel.co.uk/timetables.htm Thames travel bus X2] get off at the Vineyard or Stratton Way and walk to [http://www.stfc.ac.uk/About+STFC/44.aspx Coseners house]

If you are arriving later and wish to take a taxi/minicab from Oxford to Coseners House, there is a taxi rank at the final Oxford "airline" stop (Gloucester Green coach station). More information about taxi/minicab servcies in Oxford are on [http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decTS/Public_transport_occw.htm this page].

==Logistics==

People arriving for the NIAC and staying on for 
NOBUGS conference the following week at [http://www.stfc.ac.uk/About+STFC/51.aspx| RAL]
can keep their rooms in Cosner's. Daily transport will be available to and from the NOBUGS venue at the RAL site.

The meeting fee for NIAC/Nexus code camp is the Coseners house 24 hour delegate rate, which covers Dinner, B+B, plus lunch. So: 
* the code camp fee will cover dinner on Monday and Tuesday evenings, 2 nights accommodation, breakfast+lunch on Tuesday and Wednesday.   
* the NIAC fee will cover dinner on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, 2 night accommodation, breakfast+lunch on Thursday and Friday.

**Coffee break

* Quo Vadis
 - Intro by Mark
   - existence since 1996 and uptake is slow
   - Do we persist in the same manner or change our ways?
   - Others often reinvent NeXus
   - New instruments often implement NeXus
   - results of survey are surprisingly positive with more NeXus implementations than expected
   - New developments:
     - Dictionary Based Programming Techniques - Common Data Model (CDM)
     - Tree Based Programming
     - Requirements for data formats changing
       - disks are cheap
       - full logging becomes possible
       - data rates are very high in some cases
 - AS: ESRF advocate dictionary/HDF5 and just use the few parts of NeXus they want and ignore the rest (very pragmatic view).
 - TR: Need to take larger view and not get tied up in technical details. need to engage with facilities using NeXus (eg ALBA).
 - BW: Need to emphasise community involvement - dictating standards is historical problem of creating an example to start with.
 - JW: What is NeXus, is it something interchangeable? Have we been truthful about what it can achieve? I have no problem in maintaining tools to convert data to whatever format the users ask for.
 - JH: Users want physical meaning for the data recorded, not just numbers whose meaning is obscured by instrument details. But to understand the instrument, also need more raw values.
 - MK: Different use cases; 1. understanding instrument (raw values), 2. exchange/data analysis (physical)
 - GW: Standard has value if I can read and understand a file without any further information. As soon as you move away from that, it becomes a huge problem to support the variants.
 - HB: Seen 2 issues; dictionary of names and format. People can use any format and you have no control anyway. The only thing you need is that every uses a common vocabulary. vocabularies tend to merge. separate vocab and application definitions.
 - FA: if we concentrate app defs and vocab, then we are working towards standards, tools are not required (there are plenty available). People are choosing HDF5, help them come together and talk.
 - GW: data rates are a problem - HDF5 are needed. Don't want to have facility-specific dialects of NeXus. Need consistence and completeness (single file).
 - AS: performance issues get in the way of a single file, multiple files must be acceptable.
 - GW: don't water it down - all or nothing!
 - EW: I tried to invent better than NeXus but failed. Users just want basic data, but beamline scientist want to record everything in order to know what the instrument is actually doing. Sometimes will need to correct for strange instrument behavior that requires info not normally needed by users. Making this general enough to use at more than one beamline quickly leads to something NeXus-like.
 - HB: Offer - if you can agree on your vocab, I'll give you an IUCr working group for adopting/working on your dictionary. I.e. CIF and NeXus join forces! 
 - JW: I support this. Clarity would help me. vocab is valuable to me, but formats are minor technical details.
 - EW: Important thing is to make entry to Nexus easy. Some instruments are unique and we don't have to worry about them. OO can help us define terms. 
 - HB: we use "prefixes" for namespaces, but are considering using general XML. want to make sure terms don't conflict.
 - PJ: have image that NeXus legislates, but we should put out message that we want to collaborate to reduce conflicts.
 - MK: make an action that we concentrate on dictionaries and appl defs.
 - GW: ImageCIF has good library that does a lot of work for me. It would be easier to persuade people to use Nexus if we had the same kind of library - part of analysis work is done by the library.
 - HB: maintaining libraries will get done if there is adoption.
 - GW: If we can get Nexus routines included in CBFlib, then my work becomes much easier. analysis program writers will not resist.
 - Everyone agrees that moving CIF and NeXus closer would be great.
 - HB: CIF will make addition docs for IUCr people and will put a link to NeXus doc from the IUCr website.
 - MK and HB: lets arrange a meeting between NIAC and IUCr to discuss cooperation.
 - GW and SC: want to make sure that IUCr don't steamroll vocabularies of other communities

 - MK: Can we put NAPI into maintenance mode?
 - PP: what is status of validation tool?
 - FA: GUI tool works and I have used it, waiting for colleague to finish CLI tool
 - FA + HB: cooperation on validation tools could be useful. NeXus backend for CBFlib validation tool is possible.
 - MK: break for lunch and after lunch we will try to bring the discussion to a close.

**Lunch break

* NeXus guiding statements:
 * The main focus of the NeXus community is to further develop the dictionaries, base classes and application definitions.
 * The NIAC is a forum for resolving issues.
 * The NIAC acts as a custodian for NeXus: definitions, examples, documentation, reference implementations.
 * NeXus can be mapped to different physical file formats:
   * HDF5 is the preferred physical file format.
   * NeXus-XML is the currently supported ASCII file format.
- vote: for 8, against 1, abstain 0

* We should put together a wish-list of features to forward to the HDF group

*Statements/promises:
 * NAPI and applications are considered stable
 * The use of NAPI is not mandatory and examples using HDF5 APIs will be provided
 * The validation tool is actively developed
- vote: for 12, against 0, abstain 1

* We seek cooperation with IUCr and CIF
  * Have a meeting with them to figure out what this means
    * Maybe have another NIAC next year to agree on this (in conjunction with ECM)
    * MK volunteers to take a lead
  * We encourage the inclusion of NeXus into CBFlib

* We invest into cleaning up NeXus, remove outdated, old or broken stuff
* We invest into documenting NeXus better through bringing inheritance or composition to NeXus base classes
-vote for 14

** Coffee break

* What do we do in terms of advocating NeXus?
 - Persue new facilities? existing instruments? Analysis/reduction software?
 * Support users and program writers on the mailing lists
 * NeXus-developers merged into NeXus mailing list
 * Approach facilities using NeXus but not represented in the NIAC and encourage them to nominate new NIAC candidates.

* HB elected into NIAC as the CIF representative. for 14, against 0 

* AS: proposes flattening the heirarchy in NeXus files.
 - What he really means is that the NXxas application appears to require links to specific locations and he wants the application definition to be simpler.
 - Do we want to allow application definitions to be flat and simple (not implement the full instrument description)?
    - vote: for 12, against 2, abstain 1.
 * We recommend to use the NeXus heirarchy in application definitions, but we do accept application definitions with a flattened heirarchy.


* heading on web page is wrong: "NeXus Application Classes" --> "NeXus Application Definitions" in http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/ClassDefinitions.html

* Who is using NXcharacterisation?
 - PP added it but isn't using it because icat is better.
 * deprecate it

* continue support for the F77 API?
 - don't expend effort on it, but don't throw it away either.

* Examined NXarpes application definition
 - suggest talking to someone using a toroidal analyser
 - minor corrections pointed out.

*** END DAY ***

21 Sept 2012

* Elect new officers
 * Candidates:
   - Chairman: MK; vote - for for 13, against 0, abstain 1
   - Executive secretary: TR; vote - for for 13, against 0, abstain 1
   - Technical chair: FA; vote - for for 13, against 0, abstain 1
   - Documentation chair: PJ; vote - for for 14, against 0, abstain 0

* PJ presents the new sphinx-generated documentation, using the draft currently available at: http://download.nexusformat.org/sphinx/
 - Looks nicer
 - not everything works currently, but can be fixed - no apparent show-stoppers.
 - cannot easily have automatic numbering of figures is biggest disadvantage
   - MK, FA: that's OK, we can drop it.

* Roadmap to object oriented (OO) NeXus
 - base classes would be OO with some kind of inheritance
 - this would make the base classes clearer to users
 * vote: for 12, against 1, abstain 0

* Multidimensional axes proposal from TR
 - use of @signal=I is easily confused with signal=1 (position is different though).
   - suggest changing name
 - How many multiple competing versions do we want to encourage/support/allow?
 - How many plots should be put into each NXdata?
 * Move signal and axes attributes into NXdata group attributes. vote - for 12, against 0, abstain 2
 * Accept as a possible solution and invite TR to present sample implementations. vote - for 12, against 1, abstain 1

*** Coffee Break ***

* DECTRIS
 - HDF5 doesn't support parallel writing with compression - need a workaround!
   - write a master file (with metadata) with links to separate files for data (with ~10,000 images in each).
   - want to use non-standard compression (not distributed with mainline HDF5 libraries)
   - comment from code camp: ask for tool to convert to HDF5 standard compression.
 - Meeting with DECTRI and customers in October - who wants to attend? MK
 - FA: maybe use detector bank approach?
 - EW: split file drive approach would work better.
 - HB & MK: this is a bug in HDF5, but DECTRIS can't wait for it to be fixed (years)
 - EW: are they using the most recent version; performance problems before 1.8.6
 - HB: they are and plan to ship with 1.8.10
 * Motion to work as closely as possible with this community to get this under NeXus. vote - for all.

* BW presents mechanism for verifying communities and resolving conflicts
 - good idea and will keep in mind but do not want to consider implementing until a real need arises.

* Process for ratifying changes to NeXus classes.
 - waiting for the NIAC to meet makes changes slow.
 - minor changes can waste time at NIAC meetings.
 - allow non-breaking changes to base classes, etc to be ratified via mailing lists?
 * Changes to base classes must be ratified tech committe and put on the nexus mailing list to allow a 4 week period for objections. vote - for 12

* Do we investigate better ways to record "timed data"
 - NXlog mostly works, but probably not optimal
 - HB: Verner Banger is collaborating with the HDF group on this topic - should look at his work

BW: It would be nice if we could have option items in application definitions
PP: Already can! you just set the "minimum required" attribute to zero.

*** Lunch Break ***

* Materials definition (samples, filters, multilayers)
 - Tech committee suggest just using a descriptive string
 - HB: look at protein data base and see what they are doing. follow community standards where they exist
 - EW: infinite levels of detail makes it impossible to standardise. Maybe use application definitions for community specific materials descriptions.
 - NXsample already has "chemical formula" (using CIF conventions), "description"
 - we would be open to suggestions from the community

* Time based data
 - event streams need to be time-stamped and correlated
EW: NXlog is fine if you have single values with time stamps. how to handle detectors?
MK: You need to have a sufficiently precise timing system that all the computers have access to.
AS: Market is maturing, let's wait and see what works in the community
PP: why not just let time be an independent variable?
MK: people will want to know which things need to be correlated.
* Motion to ask tech committee to investigate possible solutions to recommend to users. vote - for 12, against 0, abstain 1

* Interaction with HDF group?
 - we should try, but we don't know if we have leverage to motivate them to pay attention
EW: spoke to Heiner Billich: facilities should get together to make requests and pool funding - but should NeXus be part of this effort?
MK: NIAC might not be a good representative for that activity, this is beyond the scope of NIAC.
HB: Should make polite contact and say that we want HDF5 to work well - what can we do to help? What does the HDF group want the interaction with NIAC to be? NeXus should encourage the discussion.
 * motion to support AS to open discussion with the HDF group on behalf of the NIAC. vote - for 12, against 0, abstain 1

* Examples of NeXus data files following application definitions.
 - PP: we wrote application definitions to match our files, so I have some.
JW: is it working? why are there so few compliant examples?
MK: It has taken some time to solidify a base to begin testing compliance
HB: we have driving force from facilities
BW: A code camp activity could be to generate example files for a new instrument.

 * Promises to supply valid example files:
   - MK: 6-10
   - PP, FA: 3
   - SC: 1
   - TR: 2

* Advocacy?
 - Not yet ready - need to examine files currently being generated for consistency. Need to clarify what we recommend.
 - We invite the community to write application definitions as a way of planning towards a standard, even if they don't intend to switch yet.

* Optional fields in application definitions? vote - for all
 - while it is already possible, we clarify that we want it.
 - FA: is there a way to have the presence of one tag be dependent on the presence of another? TR thinks so.

*** Coffee break ***

* NXdetector additions for DECTRIS
 - "exposure_time" seems unlikely to be correct. "acquisition_time" is probably better. NXdetector already has "count_time".
 - typos
 - BW volunteers to discuss the subtlties of the words they want to use for the attributes
 - threshold_energy should be type NX_ENERGY
 - _time attributes should be type NX_TIME
 * Motion to encourage use of these attributes, with the corrections discussed. vote - for 12, against 0, abstain 1

* NXbending_magnet
 - Gerd Wellenreuther proposed attribute names. BW should discuss with him and sort out issues (specifically source_distance_x and __y)
 - BW to better document accepted_photon_beam_divergence (does it overlap with the divergence_x_minus etc?)
 - divergence attributes overlap - slight preference for a single array.

* NXcapillary
 - needs "material" attribute
 - need better documentation of "gain" and "transmission"
 - model should be included in the "manufacturer" string - add doc to explain


* NXinsertion_device
 - should "taper" be an NX_LENGTH or an NX_ANGLE
 - can we change "k" to "k_parameter" in order to avoid single-character names?
 - add "period" attribute, or rename "magnetic_wavelength"
 - verify with Gerd Wellenreuther

* NXxraylens
 - rename as "NXxray_refractive_lens" for descriptiveness and consistency
 - "aperture" doc to specify diameter only
 - correct lens_geometry options
 - Put to an expert because we don't have time/expertise

* Term limits of Chairman and Secretary
 - currently limited to 3 years
 - problem if terms end between major meetings
 - want to make it more likely that term limits occur at full NIAC meetings
 * Motion to set the term length to 2 years and the limit for executive officers as two terms. for 11, against 0, abstain 0
