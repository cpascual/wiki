NeXus Code Camp
===============

Purpose
-------

Develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those
attending the NeXus Code Camp will already have strong foundation and
understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. The specific projects and tasks, as well as the list of
participants, will be described on this wiki as the event draws near.

(For more info on code camps, try searching Google for “code camp” or
“codeathon”. Events such as the [EPICS
Codeathon](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php) would be
reasonable templates for this first NeXus code camp.)
