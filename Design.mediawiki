===Data Items===
Data items contain the essential information stored in a NeXus file. They can be scalar values or multidimensional arrays of a variety of sizes (1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte, 8-byte) and types (integers, floats, characters). The items may store both experimental results (counts, detector angles, etc), and other information associated with the experiment (start and end times, user names, etc). Data items are identified by their names, which must be unique within the group in which they are stored.
