The MARS experience showed me that it is easy to get confused about the NeXus coordinate systems. I therefore suggest the
following:

*Remove coordinates from all component DTD
*Make a documentation page describing our two coordinate systems:
**The simple polare_angle, distance etc system
**The NXgeometry system
*State that coordinate describing datasets can occur in any component group
*State that one system must be used throughout the whole definition

The last point should prohibit to have both NXgeometry and simple coordinates in one DTD. This can be
confusing. As NXgemoetry is anyway intended to be used by the simulation community this should be OK.

==NeXus Coordinate System==

The NeXus coordinate system is based on the [http://mcstas.risoe.dk/ McStas coordinate system]. The instrument is given a global, absolute coordinate system where the z axis points in the direction of the incident beam, the x axis is perpendicular to the beam in the horizontal plane pointing left as seen from the source, and the y axis points upwards.

NXdetector defines a polar_angle and an azimuthal_angle. These quantities correspond exactly to the usual [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinates polar coordinate definitions] i.e. the polar angle is measured with respect to the z axis and the azimuthal angle to the x axis. The polar angle is often referred to as the ''Bragg angle'' or ''two theta''.
