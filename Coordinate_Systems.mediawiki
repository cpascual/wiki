The MARS experience showed me that it is easy to get confused about the NeXus coordinate systems. I therefore suggest the
following:

*Remove coordinates from all component DTD
*Make a dosumentation page describing our two coordinate systems:
**The simple polare_angle, distance etc system
**The NXgeometry system
*State that coordinate describing datasets can occur in any component group
*State that one system must be used throughout the whole definition

The last point should prohibit to have both NXgeometry and simple coordinates in one DTD. This can be
confusing. As NXgemoetry is anyway intended to be used by the simulation community this should be OK.
