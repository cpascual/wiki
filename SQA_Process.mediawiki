==Context==
This process is a living document that is intended to change over time. Rather than try to follow 'best practices' from the beginning it was decided to document current practices and modify them over time as deficiencies are found. To this point the testing suite will be the main tool for maintaining quality of the releases and will have additional tests added as new features are added and defects are corrected.

==Roles==
;Release manager: Person in charge of determining what features are to be included in a version and when a milestone should be closed.
;Quality manager: Oversees the addition of individual tests coordinates tests being executed with the appropriate configuration on the appropriate systems.
;Developer: Works on individual changes.

==Milestone Conventions==
For each versioned release of the code there will be two milestones: one associated with feature enhancement, and one with fixing defects introduced by the new features. The following milestone names are examples where the release version is '4.0'

;4.0 Ready: The next set of features are defined. Known defects can also be added to this milestone.
;4.0 Release: Any defects discovered while testing the '4.0 Ready' milestone.

==Code Versioning==
This discussion assumes that the version in progress is '4.0'.
* Day-to-day changes will be made to the <tt>trunk</tt> of the repository during the 'Ready' phase of development.
* Once all of the tickets associated with the 'Ready' phase are closed a branch will be created from the trunk. '''this needs to be tested'''
<pre>
$svn cp -m "Creating 4.0 branch" https://svn.nexusformat.org/code/trunk https://svn.nexusformat.org/code/branches/4.0
</pre>
* Fixes to defects found during the the 'Ready' stage are done in the <tt>branch</tt> and then merged back into the trunk. '''this needs to be tested'''
<pre>
NEED TO DOCUMENT THE COMMAND
</pre>
* Once all of the tickets in the 'Release' stage are completed the <tt>branch</tt> is tagged directly. Note that all changes to the branch should be merged back into the <tt>trunk</tt> by this time as well. '''this needs to be tested'''
<pre>
$svn cp -m "Tagging 4.0" https://svn.nexusformat.org/code/branches/4.0 https://svn.nexusformat.org/code/tags/4.0.
</pre>
* Once the final release is tagged the <tt>branch</tt> can be safely removed. '''this needs to be tested'''
<pre>
$svn rm -m "Removing branch" https://svn.nexusformat.org/code/branches/4.0
</pre>

==Testing==
The principle of testing is that automated testing will be used to find the majority of defects in the code. This decision was made based on the fact that The NeXus code is developed almost exclusively by volunteer work. All tests that are applicable to a particular configuration will be run using
<pre>
$make check
</pre>
