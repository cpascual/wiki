==System Requirements==
'''MXML XML Parsing Library'''

Version 2.2.2 of mxml is required. Earlier versions have a bug and the XML API will not work. This package can be downloded in [http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/software.php both source and binary rpm form] and is also available as part of [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/UsingExtras Fedora Extras]. IMPORTANT NOTE: Debian also provides the mxml package, but it based on 2.0 and will not work properly.

==Building Notes==
===NAG F90/F95 Compiler===
The NAG compiler needs the '''-mismatch''' flag to be specified or else it will not compile NXmodule.f90 This is achieve by running configure with the '''FCFLAGS''' environment variable set to contain the flag e.g.
<pre>
env FCFLAGS="-mismatch" ./configure --with-f90=f95
</pre>
===HDF4 on Intel Macs===
There is a problem with the include file, hdfi.h (normally in /usr/local/include).  See http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/helparc/software/msg00069.html for details of the modifications necessary to fix it.

==New Features==
* New types NX_INT64 and NX_UINT64 to suppport 64 bit integers (only available in HDF5 and XML) [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/87 details].
* Python bindings are now included in the Windows install kit [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/86 details]

==Miscellaneous bug fixes==
The following items are bugs reported in previous releases and resolved in
the 4.1 release.
* The Fortran 90 part of testsuite failed with the Absoft compiler on MacOSX (it passed with g95 and gfortran (4.2)) [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/68 details here]
* NXputattr assumed NULL termination of NX_CHAR attributes, which is usually the case in C but not true for JAVA. A workaround is to add '\0' manually [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/83 bug report]
* pkgconfig issue [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/84 bug report]
* Build issue with MXML-2.3 [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/91 bug report]
* XML buffer resizing performance issue [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/92 bug report]
* Documentation is now installed to "datadir" (/usr/share) [http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/ticket/93 bug report]
