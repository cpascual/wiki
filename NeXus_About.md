In recent years, a number of scientists and computer programmers working
in neutron and synchrotron facilities around the world came to the
conclusion that a common data format would fulfil a valuable function in
the scattering community. As instrumentation becomes more complex and
data visualization become more challenging, individual scientists, or
even institutions, have found it difficult to keep up with new
developments. A common data format makes it easier, both to exchange
experimental results and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them. It
promotes greater cooperation in software development and stimulate the
design of more sophisticated visualization tools.

The NeXus data format was developed to meet these goals. This wiki is
used for discussions concerning the development and maintenance of the
format. Please refer to the [NeXus web pages](http://www.nexus.anl.gov/)
for official documentation.
