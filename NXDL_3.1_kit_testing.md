Installers for mac, windows and linux (rpm/deb) as well as tar and zip
archives are now available at:

currently windows default installs to “c:\\Progam files\\NeXus
Definitions” – should that be “c:\\Progam files\\NeXus Definitions 3.1”
to give you the option to have more than one version of the
manual/definitions installed at a later date? Mac default installs to
“/usr/local/share/nexus” – is that the best/natural place?
