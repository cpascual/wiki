The conference dinner will take place at [Habel
Weinkultur](http://www.wein-habel.de/maine.php) in Mitte, not far from
the “Brandenburger Tor”
(\[<http://www.berlin.de/stadtplan/map.asp?ADR_ZIP=10117&ADR_STREET=Luisenstr>.&ADR\_HOUSE=19&show=108
plan\]). I reserve the table at 20:00 (25. September 2007).

I order the “Berlin Menu No. 1”:

-   Berlin ceps-potato-soup with fresh marjoram
-   Smoked saddle of young pork with cumin gravy on Riesling sauerkraut
    with herbs potatoes
-   Marinated berries with honey- poppy seed- vanilla sauce

If somebody don't like pork, **please inform me 10 days before!** I will
order the meals at the 17th September.

So you can eat the “Berlin Menu No. 2”

-   Berlin cray-fish soup with crayfish tails
-   Pike perch fillets roasted on the skin on black salsify with leek
    and peas and to herbs- rice edge
-   Apple fritters in hot pepper-cinnamon-sugar on wild berry cream

or a “Vegetarian” Menu.

Feel free to add this information in the [ list of
attendees](NIAC2007_attendees "wikilink").

There is time for a “small” sight seeing tour before or/and after the
dinner.

Visit the BER II
----------------

We can visit the experimental hall with thermal instruments and the new
and old neutron guide hall for cold neutrons. Please inform me if you
are interested or if the date is untimely for you.
