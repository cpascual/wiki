Conference Dinner
-----------------

The conference dinner will take place at [Habel
Weinkultur](http://www.wein-habel.de/maine.php) in Mitte, not far from
the “Brandenburger Tor”
(\[<http://www.berlin.de/stadtplan/map.asp?ADR_ZIP=10117&ADR_STREET=Luisenstr>.&ADR\_HOUSE=19&show=108
plan\]). I reserve the table at 20:00 (25. September 2007).

I order the “Berlin Menu No. 1”:

-   Berlin ceps-potato-soup with fresh marjoram
-   Smoked saddle of young pork with cumin gravy on Riesling sauerkraut
    with herbs potatoes
-   Marinated berries with honey- poppy seed- vanilla sauce

If somebody don't like pork, **please inform me 10 days before!** So you
can eat the “Berlin Menu No. 2”

-   Berlin cray-fish soup with crayfish tails
-   Pike perch fillets roasted on the skin on black salsify with leek
    and peas and to herbs- rice edge
-   Apple fritters in hot pepper-cinnamon-sugar on wild berry cream

There is time for a “small” sight seeing before or/and after the dinner.
